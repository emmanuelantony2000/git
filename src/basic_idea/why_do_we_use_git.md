# Why do we use Git?
The direct answer to the question is that we are humans, and we make mistakes. And when a lot of people are working together, the number of errors rises exponentially. We need something or someone to keep track of all the data that is produced by a group of people. Now if it is a "someone", then there is a chance of more errors creeping in. But if it is a "something", then yes, if that "something" is well built, it will serve just fine controlling all the errors and conflicts that creep in. And that "something" is a version control system.
