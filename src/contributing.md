# Contributing
If you liked my work please do contribute and make it better.

Adding new chapters or modifying/editing the existing ones would be a great help.

Here is the [Github Link](https://github.com/emmanuelantony2000/git).

## How to Contribute?
1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone the repository to your local system.
3. Inside the `src` folder there are markdown files.
4. Make changes wherever needed in those markdown files.
5. If you want to add new chapters then add the subsequent sub-chapters inside the folder named after the chapter name.
6. After all the new changes, you have to edit the `SUMMARY.md` inside the `src` folder.
7. The guide to edit `SUMMARY.md` is [here](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/mdBook/format/summary.html).
8. If you want to build the project and see the changes yourself then you have to install the `mdbook` utility. To install this, you need `cargo`, which gets installed when you install Rust. To install Rust, click [here](https://rustup.rs).
9. Building the project is not completely necessary. A basic rough idea is more than enough. Whatever changes you make to the `.md` files and `SUMMARY.md` will be reflected back on the website after your changes are merged on to the original repository.
10. After making the changes, submit a pull request with details about your changes, and it will be considered.

If you don't have that much time to go through this big process, but you still want to contribute, then just submit an issue.
